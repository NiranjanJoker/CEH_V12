Golden Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) attacks are implemented to target identity providers on cloud networks such as the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) that utilize the SAML protocol for the authentication and authorization of users. Attackers initially gain administrative access to the identity provider’s user profile and exploit token signing certificates to generate forged SAML tokens or responses by manipulating the SAML assertions. This access can be achieved through session hijacking, privilege escalation, or lateral movement via previously exploited vulnerabilities or attacks.

 Internet Layer: This is a crucial layer as it serves as the main component in carrying out communication between two endpoints, such as device-to-device, device-to-cloud, device-to-gateway, or back-end data sharing.
> + Access Gateway Layer: This layer helps to bridge the gap between two endpoints, such as a device and a client. The initial data handling also takes place in this layer. This layer carries out message routing, message identification, and subscribing.
> + **Middleware Layer**: This is one of the most critical layers that operates in two-way mode. It is responsible for important functions such as data management, device management, and various issues like data analysis, data aggregation, data filtering, device information discovery, and access control.
> + Edge Technology Layer: This layer consists of all the hardware components, including sensors, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, readers, or other soft sensors, and the device itself.

Cancellation Methodology: Attackers use dual signal transmission to cancel out individual spoofed signals by introducing false satellite data. The targeted signals are initially spoofed, where the latter is added with a false component that deceives the targeted GNSS receiver. This method is beneficial to the attacker in terms of extracting the code phase data but limited in terms of obtaining the amplitude matching and carrier phase.
> + Meaconing Method: Attackers aim to block and re-broadcast the original signals for masking the actual signal toward the targeted receiver. This attack is effective with mono- and multi-antenna meaconers that control multiple satellites and allows attackers to manipulate the original signal with false positioning data and delay timings. Attackers prefer this method when it is impossible for a spoofer to generate a spreading sequence.
> + **Drag-off Strategy:** Attackers track the receiver’s position and identify the deviation from the original location to a fake one. Attackers initiate this technique by mirroring the original navigation signals, injecting a progressive misalignment between those signals, and forwarding them to the GNSS receiver. The drag-off strategy is an effective attack that protects attackers from detection by radar systems.
> + Interrupting the Lock Mechanism: Attackers aim to discover a GNSS receiver’s new lock via a faulty signal. Attackers initiate this process by radiating a jamming signal inside the GNSS receiver, where the receiver requests for the next acquisition. Then, a signal simulator is used to generate a false signal, transmit it to the GNSS targeted receiver, and gain the new lock data of the receiver.

The Xmas scan is an old stealth scan technique that bypasses stateful firewalls by clearing the SYN header from TCP packets and replacing it with FIN, PSH, and URG bits or headers. 

IP ID header scanning (also known as idle or dumb scanning) is an extremely effective method of performing stealth scans. The scan is accomplished by using a third system as a proxy to pass requests between the attacker and target without any traffic ever passing directly between the attacker and target systems.

Session splicing is a method used by attackers to intercept and monitor network traffic by inserting their own device between the target server and an authorized device.
